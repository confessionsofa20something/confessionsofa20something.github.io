          I think of myself as a journaling pro since I’ve kept a pretty
          consistent journal since 2020. And let me say, its been a game-changer
          for my mental health. I tried to bottle every emotion up so as not to
          overwhelm or irritate my friends and family. But that did not work,
          and I had a quarter-life crisis every other week.

          Writing all my thoughts and feelings in a physical journal felt so
          daunting, and the idea of someone accidentally stumbling across it
          made me shudder. If you feel the same, here’s a tip: The Apple notes
          app.
        </p>

        <p>
          A very slept-on app, and its FREE! Who doesn’t love a freebie? A
          couple of key features of the notes app is the lock feature. You can
          put a passcode on each entry, which no one can access. That way, you
          don’t feel the need to censor your writing. It has come in clutch many
          times. Plus, if you’re an iPad kid like myself, and you prefer to
          write, not type your entries. You can do this with the apple pencil in
          the app; you can make doodles add photos, and spice up the page
          however you see fit. It’s amazing!
        </p>

          Another issue I had with journaling was where to start. I had so many
          thoughts rattling up in my mind, and it was hard to get pen to paper.
          A great way to overcome this is to identify why you want to journal. I
          started journaling to get to know myself better and understand who I
          was as a person. So, I started with a list of all my favourite random
          things, from Hamilton the musical to frozen yoghurt with pistachio
          spread. Think of it like the talking stage of a relationship but with
          yourself. Random, I know, but it got me started, and that’s all that
          matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          My last tip for today is just to get started. Don’t overthink it! One
          year from today, you will be so glad you started so if you take
          anything from this. Just start writing.
        </p>
        <p>Good luck x</p>
