          This past February, I was fortunate enough to solo travel to
          Edinburgh, Scotland.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a well known fact that us Muslim girls have it tough when it
          comes to travelling , moving out and everything in between. My
          situation is no different, Mama has her rules and we all must
          respectfully abide. So, how was I able to solo travel you ask? Heres
          my strict parents guide to solo travel
        </p>

        <p>Step one: Figure out where you would like to go.</p>

        <p>
          Having a specific place in mind made it so much easier for me. As much
          as I really wanted to travel alone part of me used my mum’s
          displeasure at the idea as an excuse not to; when really I was just
          nervous. So, if that resonates with you choosing a destination, and I
          mean a specific area in your chosen city, helps immensely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Side note: This is really important for me to add, our parents fear of
          solo traveling doesn’t always come from a negative place. With all the
          things going on in the world it tends to come from a place of love and
          protection rather than party pooping. So, a tip from me, research how
          safe your chosen city is. Make sure someone you trust has your
          location and try to explore when its light out.
        </p>

        <p>Step two: Don’t ask, tell</p>

        <p>
          This step wont work for everyone but creating boundaries with your
          parents is so important. You can still respect their wishes without
          throwing all your dreams out the window. Now this is going to be super
          hard to start, but it’s such an important first step to freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the most part our parents say no because we give them the option.
          If you come into this with confidence and convince yourself it’s a
          done deal they tend to get on board a lot faster. Keep the
          conversation light and casual, the more you freak out the bigger deal
          you make it. It’s not that serious, convince yourself and you convince
          them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Warning, this isn’t always going to work on the first try. I got hit
          with a lot of no’s before my first yes so be patient and keep trying.
        </p>

        <p>Step three: Find a reason to be there.</p>

        <p>
          Fun isn’t something strict parents understand. At least thats what
          they want us to believe. So a sure way to get what you want is to give
          them a reason to say yes. “Mama I want to go to Scotland because it
          sounds fun.” is a sure way to be put on house arrest. But “Mama Im
          going to Scotland to attend {insert name of important work/school
          event here}” is just the right amount of respectful and grown. At
          least for the first few trips, giving them some kind of safety
          association will ease their nerves. Try to cater your trips around
          cities of close friends/relatives or important events like academic or
          religious talks. This doesn’t have to ruin the solo trip vibes if your
          smart about getting a hotel or airbnb and it doesn’t have to be a lie
          if you really attend said lecture while your there. You have to make
          it make sense to them that’s the way you get what you want.
        </p>

        <p>You got this, if I can do it you can too!</p>

        <p>But if it all goes to shit you never heard it from me!</p>

        <p>Yours truly,</p>
